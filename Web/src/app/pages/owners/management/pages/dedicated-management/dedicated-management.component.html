            <h3 class="sub-title-intro">ALIGNED INTERESTS</h3>
            <p>
                Your Property Manager is typically paid a percentage of the homes they manage, so having
                tenants that pay their rent on time is in their best interest as well as yours. Keeping
                quality tenants in your home is an advantage for both you and your Property Manager so they
                are very renewal focused.
            </p>
